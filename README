->Implementing Quotation services as a separate web service. The broker service should then use
a web services client to connect to each of these services, requesting quotations.
Given your previous work on the vetting service, you are also required to implement this service in the new system.
To help you with this, you have found a version 2.0 of the local service implementation that includes a vetting service.
This revised source code is provided on moodle. Please be aware that the changed package structure has been done
on purpose to make the implementation of the web services easier. This is because the package structure is used to
define XML namespaces in web services and the Jax-WS implementation does not like working with services whose
interface and implementation are in separate packages. 

There are 4 packages-
core, implementation, quotation, vetting and test.
Align all the java files respectively.
